# DexCom Glucose Level Plot

This is a program that creates a plot of the exported DexCom data (a csv from
the clarity website). There are instructions on how to obtain the export on
[the dexcom FAQ page](https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/can-i-export-raw-data).
You might need to chose the right clarity website region. For europe it is
clarity.dexcom.eu (probably for the data protection reasons).

# Example

Running `./plot.py example/example_export_data.csv` produces this plot:

![Example plot](example/plot.png)

# Running the program
